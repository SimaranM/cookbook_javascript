                                There are few dishes simpler and more satisfying than a classic baked potato . When
                                prepared and cooked correctly, baked potatoes have the potential to be the star of a
                                meal, especially since they're incredibly versatile, inexpensive, and filling. While

                                , there are many ways to enjoy baked spuds as a meal itself.

                            <h3>Preparation</h3>
                            <p>One of the most common mistakes when baking potatoes is tightly wrapping them up in foil
                                and tossing them into the oven. According to Joshua Resnick, chef-instructor at the
                                Institute of Culinary Education , there are simple ways to enhance the flavor by
                                achieving that sensational crispy skin. Resnick suggests giving your potatoes a thorough
                                salt scrub, which helps to tenderize them and remove any dirt. "Add a good amount of
                                salt and enough water to make a loose paste, and then just use your hands to rub the
                                salt all over the potatoes," he advises.</p>
                            <h3>Cooking Methods</h3>
                            <p>Have you ever dug into a soft, fluffy baked potato at a restaurant and wondered how to
                                get that beautiful, buttery consistency when cooking them at home? Natural food chef and
                                certified nutritionist Liana Werner-Gray knows the secret. She begins by boiling the
                                potatoes for 15 minutes, and then draining them to steam-dry. This method pre-cooks the
                                potatoes, allowing the inside to get nice and soft. </p>
